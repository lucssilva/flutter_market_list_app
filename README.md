# CRUD Example
## Getting Started
1. Run in the terminal `flutter create .` to generate ios/android folders.
2. Step 1 will replace some ios / android configuration files that are needed to build the project, so it will be necessary to discard changes made to those folders.
3. If `pubspec.lock` not exist in root folder, run in the terminal `flutter pub get`.
