# CRUD Example
Before cloning the project, make sure to use a common name for Dart packages, our suggestion is to run: `git clone https://github.com/lucssilva/flutter-market-list-app.git market_list` but you can choose another folder name instead of market_list if you wish and it is possible to rename the project folder after too.
## Getting Started
1. Run in the terminal `flutter create .` to generate ios/android folders.
2. Step 1 will replace some ios / android configuration files that are needed to build the project, so it will be necessary to discard changes made to those folders.
3. If `pubspec.lock` not exist in root folder, run in the terminal `flutter pub get`.
